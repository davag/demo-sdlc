# Product Requirements Document: Task Management App with Priority Filtering

## Executive Summary
Build a modern task management application that allows users to create, organize, and filter tasks by priority levels. The app should provide an intuitive interface with real-time updates and smooth user experience.

## Problem Statement
Teams and individuals need a simple yet effective way to manage tasks with priority-based filtering to focus on what matters most. Current solutions are either too complex or lack proper priority management features.

## Solution Overview
Create a React-based task management app with the following core features:
- Task creation with priority assignment (High, Medium, Low)
- Priority-based filtering system
- Task status management (Todo, In Progress, Completed)
- Clean, responsive UI with dark/light theme support
- Real-time task updates

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack (as defined in .cursorrules)
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, scalable state management
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit and integration testing
- **Routing**: React Router DOM for navigation
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + TypeScript for code quality enforcement

### Architecture Constraints
- Follow cursor rules defined in .cursorrules file
- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Components must be under 100 lines when possible
- Use proper error boundaries and error handling
- Maintain accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Implement responsive design (mobile-first approach)

### File Structure Requirements
- `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components (PascalCase naming)
- `/src/pages/` - Page-level components
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom hooks (usePrefix naming)
- `/src/store/` - Zustand store definitions
- `/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/utils/` - Utility functions

### Development Standards
- All components must have proper TypeScript interfaces
- Use arrow functions for component definitions
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch for async operations
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility
- Implement proper loading states and error messages
- Follow React best practices (proper key props, avoiding unnecessary re-renders)

## Core Features

### 1. Task Management
- Create new tasks with title, description, and priority
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks with confirmation
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete

### 2. Priority System
- Three priority levels: High (Red), Medium (Yellow), Low (Green)
- Visual indicators for each priority level
- Default priority assignment (Medium)

### 3. Filtering System
- Filter by priority (All, High, Medium, Low)
- Filter by status (All, Todo, In Progress, Completed)
- Combine multiple filters
- Clear all filters option

### 4. User Interface
- Clean, modern design following Material Design principles
- Responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Loading states for all async operations

### 5. Data Persistence
- Store tasks in localStorage for demo purposes
- Maintain filter preferences across sessions
- Preserve theme selection

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Task Creation and Management
- As a user, I can create a new task with a title, description, and priority
- As a user, I can edit existing tasks
- As a user, I can delete tasks I no longer need
- As a user, I can mark tasks as complete or incomplete

### Epic 2: Priority-Based Organization
- As a user, I can assign priority levels to my tasks
- As a user, I can filter tasks by priority to focus on important items
- As a user, I can see visual indicators for different priority levels

### Epic 3: User Experience
- As a user, I can switch between dark and light themes
- As a user, I can use the app on mobile and desktop devices
- As a user, I can see loading states and error messages
- As a user, I can navigate the app using keyboard shortcuts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Models
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  status: 'todo' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface FilterState {
  priority: 'all' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  status: 'all' | 'todo' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
}
```

### Component Architecture
- **App**: Main application component with routing
- **TaskList**: Display filtered tasks
- **TaskItem**: Individual task component
- **TaskForm**: Create/edit task form
- **FilterBar**: Priority and status filters
- **ThemeToggle**: Dark/light theme switcher
- **Header**: Application header with navigation

### State Management
- Use Zustand for global state (tasks, filters, theme)
- Local component state for form inputs and UI states
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all store states

## Success Metrics
- Users can create and manage tasks efficiently
- Priority filtering helps users focus on important tasks
- App is responsive and accessible across devices
- Code follows all cursor rules and maintains high quality
- Zero accessibility violations in audit
- All TypeScript strict mode requirements met

## Constraints and Limitations
- Demo project scope (no backend integration)
- Use localStorage for data persistence
- Follow all cursor rules without exceptions
- Maximum 100 lines per component where possible
- All components must be fully typed with TypeScript

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Setup and basic task creation (2-3 hours)
- **Phase 2**: Priority system and filtering (1-2 hours)
- **Phase 3**: UI polish and theming (1-2 hours)
- **Phase 4**: Testing and accessibility (1 hour)

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Backend integration
- User authentication
- Task sharing and collaboration
- Due dates and reminders
- Task categories and tags
