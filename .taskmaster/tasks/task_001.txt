# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the React project with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and configure ESLint according to the technical requirements.
# Details:
1. Create a new Vite project with React and TypeScript template:
```bash
npm create vite@latest task-management-app --template react-ts
cd task-management-app
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
npm install zustand react-router-dom lucide-react
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

3. Initialize Tailwind CSS:
```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

4. Configure Tailwind CSS in tailwind.config.js:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

5. Set up ESLint for TypeScript:
```bash
npm install -D eslint @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks
```

6. Create the required folder structure:
```
/src
  /components
  /pages
  /hooks
  /store
  /types
  /utils
```

7. Configure tsconfig.json for strict mode and other TypeScript settings.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project builds successfully with no errors. Run `npm run dev` to ensure the development server starts correctly. Check that ESLint is properly configured by running `npm run lint` (after setting up the lint script in package.json). Verify that all required directories are created and accessible.
